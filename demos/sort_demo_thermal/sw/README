----------------------

This directory contains all necessary files to generate the software libraries
and executables for the "sort" example application. Be sure to build the
hardware part first. See ../hw/README for details on how to do that.

When the hardware part is built, make sure your environment is set correctly,
especially the HW_DESIGN variable (it needs to be set to the absolute path
to the ../hw/edk-static directory). See ../settings.sh for the correct
setting.
See http://www.reconos.de/twiki/bin/view/ReconOS/SetupEnvironment for details.

    - Run 'make mrproper setup.mb' to build the eCos library.
    - Run 'make -f Makefile.ecos.mb.thermal clean all' to build the executable for the ReconOS/eCos system,
      using the eCos API.
    - Use the XMD to upload the executables to the XUP board.
    
There is one executable:

    sort_ecos_thermal		eCos API, single-threaded hardware version, temperature measurement

Use 'config.h' to set up the application parameters.
