----------------------

This directory contains all necessary files to generate the static EDK design
for the "sort" example application. 

    - Run 'make bits-static' to generate the bitstream.
    - Use 'dow' or iMPACT to download the bitstream to the FPGA, and continue
      with the software part (see ../sw/README).

Make sure that your environment for ReconOS is set correctly, especially
the HW_DESIGN variable. See ../settings.sh for the correct setting.
See http://www.reconos.de/twiki/bin/view/ReconOS/SetupEnvironment for details.
