Demo for the Multibus and Ethernet Reference Design of ReconOS
==============================================================

Files and Directories
---------------------
	sw/ 			everything related to the software (we use a microblaze)
	hw/ 			everything related to the hardware
	hw/hwthreads		the three hardware threads used in the design
	hw/hwthread/first	a thread that can send/receive to/from the other threads. It is put in hw slot 0.
	hw/hwthread/second	a thread that can send/receive to/from the other threads. It is put in hw slot 1.
	hw/hwthread/third	a thread that can send/receive to/from the other threads. It is put in hw slot 2.
				Additionally, this thread can send/receive to/from the Ethernet interface.

Building the Hardware
---------------------
	make sure your $RECONOS Variable is set correctly (Execute ". setenv.sh") in the main reconos folder. 
	$cd hw
	$make bits-statics
	
	The bitstream will be in hw/edk-static/implementation/system.bit

Building the Software
---------------------
	edit the settings.sh file to point to your hardware design e.g. the file content should be:
	export HW_DESIGN=/PATH/TO/YOUR/HW/DESIGN/reconos/demos/demo_multibus_ethernet/hw/edk-static
	$cd sw
	$make setup.mb
	$make ecos.mb
	
	The executable is in the same direcotry: controller.elf

Running the Demo
---------------
	setup minicom to see an output (via USB)
	connect your board to a computer (via Ethernet). 
	$dow ../hw/edk-static/implementation/system.bit
	$dow controller.elf
	
	You should see an output similar to the following:

	received 5843462 packets on thread 2 on the multibus interface
	received 0 packets on thread 2 on the Ethernet interface
	
Changing the SW
---------------
	- You can edit the controller.c file in order to change which hw thread sends to which other hw thread.
	- You can also send packets to the Ethernet interface of the FPGA card (e.g. with a ping to a broadcast address). 
	  Those packets should be reported in the last output line.
	- You can use wireshark to sniff the packets sent by the FPGA. (note, wireshark will drop some packets, since it is to slow to process all received packets).
